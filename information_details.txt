Feedback: For Tasks (T1, T2 & T3): Went well and team performance looks good but my humble request for all team member to understand topics and dig deeper into it.
Don’t be in a harry saying that I have completed my T1 or T2  as it has been assigned.
Learning topics covered in the task is import but thinking around the topics and getting more knowledge is best approach which make you more perfect and strong.
